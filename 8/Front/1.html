        produced during a period known as the Disney Renaissance. The Lion King
        was directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff, produced by Don Hahn, and
        has a screenplay credited to Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts, and Linda
        Woolverton. Its original songs were written by composer Elton John and

        takes place in a kingdom of lions in Africa and was influenced by the
        Biblical stories of Joseph and Moses, and William Shakespeare's Hamlet.
